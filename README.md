# Resume-HTML

This is my first HTML project, built using the basic skills I learned in my Web Development Bootcamp.

This website serves as my online resume, showcasing my professional timeline and experiences. It's a multi-page website, so you can click on the links that take you to my Portfolio and Contact pages. In the Portfolio page, with clickable images that redirect to their respective live websites for a better view.
